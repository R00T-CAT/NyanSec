# NYANSEC_OS

     /\_/\   Meow~ Welcome to NYANSEC_OS
    ( o.o )  A cyber-cat themed "desktop OS" in your browser
     > ^ <   Built with claws, caffeine, and pure chaos

------------------------------------------------------------

## What is this?

NYANSEC_OS is a half-serious, half-silly "operating system" that runs in your browser.  
It boots into two flavors:  
- **Terminal Mode**: hacker vibes, neon green text, typey-typey
- **GUI Mode**: draggy windows, clicky icons, start menu like itâ€™s 1999

It is *not* an actual OS, but it will happily pretend to be one.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

- **Two Modes**
  - Terminal Mode (type commands like you are in a cyberpunk movie)
  - GUI Mode (desktop with draggable windows, taskbar, and shiny icons)

- **Commands**
  - `help` ............. show all the tricks
  - `clear` ............ sweep the mess
  - `echo [text]` ...... parrot back what you said
  - `catfact` .......... drop random cat wisdom
  - `joke` ............. questionable comedy routines
  - `neofetch` ......... fake system info + ASCII cat goodness
  - `open [app]` ....... pop open an internal window (about, projects, contact, terminal)
  - `goto` ............. one-way ticket to my GitHub profile

- **GUI Windows**
  - About Me
  - Projects (file explorer cosplay)
  - Contact
  - Terminal (GUI shell for the point-and-clickers)

- **Taskbar + Start Menu**
  - Buttons, menus, nostalgia
  - Basically, a discount Windows aesthetic

- **Desktop Icons**
  - Click 'em, drag 'em, feel powerful

------------------------------------------------------------

## Why?

Because cats *own* computers already. This is just formalizing the deal.  
Also because I got bored and thought: "What if my OS was a cat?"  
And then I coded until it was true.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Setup

No frameworks. No dependencies. No npm install pain.  
Just clone it and open the HTML file:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/R00T-CAT/NYANSEC_OS.git
cd NYANSEC_OS
open index.html
```

Runs on any modern browser. Even runs on your fridge if it has Chrome.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Roadmap

- More silly apps
- A boot-up sequence that looks more catty
- Smarter terminal with more "fake Linux" commands


------------------------------------------------------------

## License

MIT License.  
Steal it, fork it, remix it. Just toss a credit to R00T-CAT somewhere.  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Contact

Run `goto` in the terminal to land on my GitHub.  
Or smash the Contact window button in the GUI.
